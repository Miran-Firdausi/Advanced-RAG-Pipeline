This document is a Family Medicare Policy from United India Insurance Company Limited. The policy is a contract of insurance that covers the person or persons named in the schedule for medical expenses arising from hospitalization due to illness or injury. The policy is based on the information provided in the proposal form, the receipt of the full premium, and is subject to its terms, conditions, and exclusions.





Key Policy Features:


Cover Type: The policy can be on an individual or a family floater basis. For the individual basis, a separate sum insured is provided for each person. For the family floater basis, a single sum insured is shared by the entire family. The maximum liability for all claims in a policy year is the sum insured specified in the schedule.




In-patient Hospitalization: The policy covers room and nursing expenses, intensive care unit (ICU) charges, fees for medical practitioners and surgeons, and a variety of other medical expenses including operation theatre charges, anesthesia, and diagnostic tests.




Day Care Treatment: The policy covers medical expenses for day care treatments that require less than 24 hours of hospitalization due to technological advancements. This does not include procedures normally taken on an outpatient basis.





Pre- and Post-Hospitalization Expenses: The policy covers relevant medical expenses incurred for up to 30 days before hospitalization and up to 60 days after discharge, subject to a maximum of 10% of the sum insured. This benefit is only available if the hospitalization claim is admissible.




AYUSH Treatment: In-patient hospitalization expenses for Ayurvedic, Homeopathic, and Unani treatments are covered up to a specified limit, provided the treatment is received in a recognized AYUSH hospital.




Health Check-up: The policy offers coverage for health check-up costs for every three claim-free years. The amount is capped at 1% of the average sum insured of the preceding three years, up to a maximum of ₹5,000 for individual policies and ₹10,000 for floater policies.
